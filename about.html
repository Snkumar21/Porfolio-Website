                            A dedicated developer and designer with a strong foundation in technology and business. 
                            I completed my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (Computer Applications) from Savitribai Phule Pune University. 
                            Currently, I am pursuing my MCA degree from Ajeenkya D Y Patil University, School of Engineering.
                        <br /><br />
                            Alongside my studies, I work as a content writer, manager, and editor for my YouTube Tech Channel, where I create engaging and educational content for a growing tech community. 
                            I have continuously enhanced my skill set through various certifications and hands-on experience.
                        <br><br>
                            With a strong foundation in development and a growing expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cyber security, I am always looking for opportunities to apply my skills to solve complex problems. 
                            My passion for continuous learning drives me to stay at the forefront of emerging technologies while managing teams and delivering high-quality content.
